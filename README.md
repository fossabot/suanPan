## Introduction

[üßÆ **suanPan**](https://tlcfem.github.io/suanPan/) is a finite element method (FEM) simulation platform for applications in fields such as solid mechanics and civil/structural/seismic engineering. The name **suanPan** (in some places such as suffix it is also abbreviated as **suPan**) comes from the term *Suan Pan* (ÁÆóÁõ§), which is [Chinese abacus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suanpan). **suanPan** is written in modern high quality C++ code and is targeted to provide an efficient, concise, flexible and reliable FEM simulation platform.

**suanPan** is partially influenced by popular (non-)commercial FEA packages, such as [ABAQUS UNIFIED FEA](https://www.3ds.com/products-services/simulia/products/abaqus/), [ANSYS](http://www.ansys.com/) and [OpenSees](http://opensees.berkeley.edu/).

Please check documentation [here](https://tlcfem.gitbook.io/suanpan-manual/) and [here](http://suanpan-manual.rtfd.io/) for command references. Please consider star ‚≠ê the project!

## Features

The highlights of **suanPan** are

- **suanPan** is *fast*, both memory and thread safe.
- **suanPan** is designed based on the [shared memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_memory) model and supports parallelism on heterogeneous architectures, for example multi-threaded CPU + optional GPU. The parallelism is available for both element state updating and global matrix assembling.
- **suanPan** is open source and easy to be expanded to incorporate user-defined elements, materials, etc.
- **suanPan** separates the FEA model part from the linear algebra operation part, which significantly reduces the complexity of development.
- **suanPan** utilizes the new language features shipped with the latest standards (C++14, C++17, etc.), such as new STL containers, smart pointers and many others.
- **suanPan** supports simple visualization supported by [VTK](https://vtk.org/).

## Quick Start

Sample models are available for almost all models/commands. Please check the `Example` folder for details.

## Installation

Only 64-bit version is compiled. It is assumed that [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) is available thus if the program fails, please check if your CPU supports AVX.

### Windows

The binaries, which are compiled with Intel MKL and VTK, are available on [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/suanpan), please use the following command to install the package.

1. Follow the [instructions](https://chocolatey.org/install) to install Chocolatey.

2. Make sure the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) is installed. Alternatively, install it via Chocolatey.

    ```
    choco install vcredist140
    ```

3. Use the following command to install `suanPan`.

    ```
    choco install suanpan
    ```

### Linux

Linux users are recommended to obtain the binaries via snap. The snap supports visualization via VTK and uses Intel MKL for linear algebra.

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-black.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/suanpan)

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/341345.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/341345)

### Other Platforms

Precompiled binaries are provided via CI/CD on MacOS, Windows and Ubuntu. Please download the file from the [release](https://github.com/TLCFEM/suanPan/releases) page.

Advanced users can compile the program from source by themselves in order to enable

1. GPU based solvers which require available [CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-toolkit-release-notes/) library;
2. Visualization support provided by VTK library;
3. High performing linear algebra provided by Intel MKL library.

On Windows, to add file associations with `.sp` and `.supan` files, please run the `AddAssociation.bat` file with admin privilege. [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) autocompletion and syntax highlighting files are also provided. Please check the `Enhancement` folder.

On Linux, since CI/CD uses `GCC 9.3.0`, thus it may be required to update/install GCC version 9 or above.

```bash
sudo apt install gcc-9 g++-9 gfortran-9 libomp5
```

For VTK enabled versions, it may be necessary to install OpenGL.

```bash
sudo apt install libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev
```
